<h1 class="text-center">How to deal with exam stress</h1>
<p><article>Exam anxiety is common, particularly if you're under pressure from your family or school. Exam stress can make you feel worried or depressed, which may have an impact on how well you sleep or what you eat.<br>  

You are not alone if you experience any of these emotions or worry that the stress of exams is affecting your daily life. Here are some ways you can try:<ol><h5>01.Let your trusted friends and family know if you are struggling</h5>
		  that they can be there to listen to you, support you, and encourage you. You do not need to experience this alone. Don't be afraid to open up since keeping everything within will just make matters worse in the long run.<br>

	<h5>02.Request assistance. Consider all the practical assistance you require.
</h5>Likewise, be sincere with yourself. You're free to solicit assistance. Discuss your worries with your instructor or tutor, who can inform you of the support that your school, college, or university can provide. They will have previously spoken with several students who are experiencing comparable issues.
		  <h5>03.Try joining or starting a study group.
</h5>
		  It can be beneficial to work through issues with other students in order to maintain your social life and enhance your spirits.
		  

</ol>
	  <center><h4>Be kind to yourself</h4></center>
	  <center><div><img src="images/kind.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt=""/></div></center>
		  Consider everything you have accomplished so far. Making a list of all the qualities you appreciate about yourself and those of other people might be useful.<br>

If someone close to you are placing pressure on you, such as your parents or family, it can be helpful to let them know what you believe you are capable of and that your expectations differ from theirs. You might also discuss the pressure you're facing at home with a teacher you trust.

		  <h3><center>The importance of self-care</center></h3>
		  <br>
		  You've definitely heard the term "self-care," but what does it actually entail? Self-care is, to put it simply, the tiny things we do to take care of our own mental health.
		  <br>
		  You might feel that you don't have time for self-care or that you need to spend all of your time studying if you're anxious about examinations. Even while revision is obviously necessary, you will find it more difficult to study if you don't take the time to take care of yourself by eating healthily, getting enough sleep, and giving yourself time to relax by engaging in activities you enjoy, like gaming or meeting friends. We all require a break occasionally because we are not machines.

Therefore, be careful to account for time to take care of yourself while planning how to use your free time before tests. You merit it.
	<br>	  Thanks!!
