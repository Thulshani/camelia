<p>The start of a new college course might be intimidating, but improving your study techniques can increase your self-assurance and success in and out of the classroom. <br> <br>

Finding the appropriate study strategy with a new course load can seem like a difficult task. For many students, the transition from the demanding high school curriculum to the intensity of college academics can be overwhelming. <br> <br>


Because they incorporate many learning styles, effective study techniques are effective. We frequently underestimate our own learning, as Jessie Schwab, a psychologist and preceptor at the Harvard College Writing Program, points us. Reciting material that has been memorized is not the same as genuinely remembering it. <br>
 According to Schwab, one finding from decades of cognitive science research is that students frequently make poor judgments about their own learning.<br> <br> "Memorization seems to be learning, but in truth, we probably haven't sufficiently deeply assimilated that information for us to remember it days—or even hours—later."<br> <br>

Your success in college depends on your ability to prepare ahead of time and seek out assistance as you go. This blog will provide study advice and methods to help you get through (and excel in!) your first college course. <br>

<p><h5><center>1)Avoid Cramming!</center> </h5> 
  Although it may be alluring to put off your study until the very last minute for that important exam, evidence indicates that cramming does not enhance long-term learning. <br><br>
  
  An article from the American Psychological Association claims that even if students may score well on a test they have studied for, it doesn't necessarily follow that they have actually understood the content. Studies have indicated that studying with the intention of long-term retention is preferable for learning in general as opposed to cramming. <br><br>  
  <h5><center>2) Plan Ahead—and Stick To It!</center></h5> 
  Having a study plan with set goals can help you feel more prepared and can give you a roadmap to follow. Schwab said procrastination is one mistake that students often make when transitioning to a university-level course load. <br><br>
  
  “Oftentimes, students are used to less intensive workloads in high school, so one of my biggest pieces of advice is don’t cram,” says Schwab. “Set yourself a study schedule ahead of time and stick to it.”<br><br>
  
  <h5><center>3) Request Support</center> </h5>
		  <br><br>
  You don't have to struggle alone with challenging material. While in high school, many students are not accustomed to asking for assistance; nevertheless, in college, this is a typical practice.
  <br><br>
  "Be proactive about identifying areas where you need assistance and seek out that assistance right away," advises our guide to pursuing a biology major. The more time you take, the more challenging it is to catch up.
  <br><br>
  You can get assistance from a variety of sources, including your teachers, tutors, and classmates. For students to stay on track, Harvard's Academic Resource Center offers academic coaching, workshops, peer tutoring, and accountability hours.   <br><br>  
  <h5><center>4) Employ a buddy system</center></h5><br><br>  
  Most likely, you and your fellow students are experiencing the same difficulties. Form a study group with your classmates to discuss the content, come up with ideas, and provide support for one another through difficult times.<br><br> 
  
  When you study with others, you may quiz and explain the content to one another as well as develop a network that will be useful for the duration of the semester and beyond.   <br><br>    
  
  
  
  
</p>
<h5><center>5)Discover Your Learning Style </center></h5><br><br>
  Finding the study techniques that are most effective for you may take some time (and trial and error!). Beyond just going over your notes or flashcards, there are many different ways to test your knowledge. <br>
Schwab advises experimenting with various tactics using the metacognition process. Knowing what study techniques work best for you entails thinking about your own cognitive processes, or metacognition. 
<p>Schwab advises putting these actions into practice:</p>
<p>*Review what you already know about the subject and what you hope to learn before beginning a new chapter or watching a lecture.<br>
  *Make extra notes as you read or listen, such as pertinent subjects the material reminds you of.</p>
